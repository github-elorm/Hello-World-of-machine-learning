# Predicting Iris Species Using Machine Learning

# Overview

This repository contains machine learning models that predicts the species type of Iris flowers based on four physical characteristics. These models use the Iris data set, implementing four classification algorithms.

# Data set

This program uses the Iris data set. The Iris dataset is a classic multivariate dataset that has 150 samples.There are four features, namely: petal length,petal width, sepal length and sepal width.It has three classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica.

# Features

Data Visualistion: Heatmap to show a plot of the correlation.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values.
Model Building: Implemented four machine learning algorithms (Decision tree classifier,Random Forest, Support Vector machines and k nearest neighbour).
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

# Requirements
Install python
